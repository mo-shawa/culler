# Culler

`Culler` is a tiny JavaScript Library that does everything you need it to do, if all you need it to do is generate an `RGBA` string ðŸŽ¨

### Features

- `Culler` currently only serves one purpose, which is to generate a random `RGBA` string using it's solitary exposed function, `genRGBA()`.
- It's TINY. This library is `significantly` smaller than 1 GB ðŸ”¥

### Built with

- TypeScript
- Love

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and NPM installed
- A project with a package.json

### Install

```bash
$ npm i culler
```

### Usage

If you are using commonJS syntax:

```js
const { genRGBA } = require('culler')

const randomColor = genRGBA() // rgba(22, 118, 117, 0.75)
const anotherColor = genRGBA() // rgba(137, 129, 49, 0.49)
```

Using ESM

```js
import { genRGBA } from 'culler'

const randomColor = genRGBA() // rgba(22, 118, 117, 0.75)
const anotherColor = genRGBA() // rgba(137, 129, 49, 0.49)
```
